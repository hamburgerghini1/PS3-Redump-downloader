## How to Use

Upon first opening the tool, it connects and downloads all available PS3 ISO images. This list will be saved in a file named _listPS3Titles.json_.

Subsequent openings will load this list from the file.

![Next Time Open](./doc/notFirstTimeOpen.png)

The app will display the message 'Find PS3 title to download'. You can input the full title or part of it to filter the list. For example, 'Europe Eye'.

![Filtering Game List](./doc/filterList.png)

Each game in the list is indexed for selection. To download a specific game, input its corresponding index. If you wish to perform a new search, simply input the desired title, and the list will be filtered accordingly.

For instance, to download '2. EyeCreate (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip (129.3 MiB)', type '2' and press Enter. The download process will commence, starting with the download and unzipping of the ISO, followed by the key and finishing with the decryption.

Once the process is complete, three new files will be created in the folder: Title_decrypted.iso and the original files (which can be deleted) Title.iso and Title.dkey.
